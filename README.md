## LMS Demo App

An end-to-end Learning Management System (LMS) built with Laravel + Inertia + React. It provides user authentication, course listings and details, enrollment flow, public course comments, events, faculty directory, and a basic admin area for managing courses, events, categories, and viewing users.

### Why this project is relevant
- **Practical LMS features**: Covers typical needs for a small-to-mid LMS: courses, enrollments, events, staff, and user accounts.
- **Modern stack**: Uses Laravel for backend and Inertia + React for a SPA-like UX without building a separate API layer.
- **Clear structure**: Easy to extend with well-separated controllers, models, migrations, and pages.

---

## Technologies

### Backend
- **Laravel**: PHP framework (see `composer.json`) for routing, validation, Eloquent ORM, queues, mail, etc.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Models and relationships for `User`, `Course`, `Category`, `Enrollment`, `Event`, `Faculty`, `Comment`.

### Frontend
- **Inertia.js**: Bridges Laravel routes to React pages without a traditional REST API.
- **React + TypeScript/JSX**: See `resources/js` for pages, components, and layouts.
- **Tailwind CSS + PostCSS**: Styling and utility classes (see `tailwind.config.*`, `resources/css/app.css`).
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool (see `vite.config.*`).

### Database
- **SQLite** (default): `database/database.sqlite`. Can switch to MySQL/PostgreSQL via `.env`.

### Key Libraries/Packages
- Laravel core packages (framework, auth, validation, migrations).
- Inertia Laravel adapter and React client.
- TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer.
- PHPUnit and Pest ecosystem via Laravel for tests.

> This section explains the most relevant directories and why they exist. Only notable files are listed; standard vendor files are omitted.

### Application (PHP)
- `app/Http/Controllers/`
  - `AdminController.php`: Admin dashboard and CRUD for Courses, Events, Categories; view users; now also exposes a course comments view.
  - `Auth/*`: Authentication controllers (register, login, password reset, email verification).

## Getting started (local)

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2+ (CLI), Composer, Node.js 18+ and npm, SQLite (or another DB driver).

### 1) Install dependencies
```bash
composer install
npm install
```

### 2) Environment
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set values.
- Default SQLite:
  - `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`
  - `DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite`
  - Ensure the file exists: `type NUL > database/database.sqlite` (Windows) or `touch database/database.sqlite` (Unix).

### 3) Migrate and seed
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

### 4) Build assets (dev)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5) Serve the app
```bash
php artisan serve
```

Login:
- User: `test@example.com` / `password`
- Admin: `admin@gmail.com` / `admin`

## How requests flow

1. Browser hits a route in `routes/web.php`.
2. Laravel controller fetches data via Eloquent.
3. Controller returns an Inertia response pointing to a React page under `resources/js/Pages/*` with props.
4. React page renders and can submit forms via Inertia (no manual API routes needed).

---

## Notes and constraints

- Categories
  - The `Category` model expects `name, slug, description, color` but the base `create_categories_table` migration currently includes only `id` and timestamps. Admin creates categories with those fields, so ensure your categories table contains these columns before using category features extensively.
  - The `add_category_id_to_courses_table` migration is currently empty; if linking courses to categories via FK, add the `category_id` column and index.

- Enrollments
  - Store a snapshot of course info at the time of enrollment and arenâ€™t strictly FK-bound to the `courses` table for all fields (only store `course_id` as number and enforce uniqueness `(user_id, course_id)`).

- Comments
  - The `comments` table must be migrated (done once with `php artisan migrate`). Users must be authenticated to post.

---

## Development tips

- Use `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` when changing schema during development.
- Use `npm run build` for production assets.
- Keep Inertia props small and typed where possible; prefer Eloquent column selection (`->get(['id', ...])`).

---

## Contributing / Extending

- Add role/ability checks for admin routes to restrict non-admin access.
- Complete categories schema and link courses with a foreign key.
- Add pagination, search, and filters for courses and comments.
- Add course content (lessons, quizzes, certificates) as future modules.
